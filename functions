A function is a named section of a program that performs a specific operation. You define it once and can use (or "call") it multiple times.

How to Define a Function:
Use the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses:

def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

This defines a function called greet that prints a message.

How to Call a Function:
Once defined, you can call the function like this:

greet()

Parameters and Arguments:
Functions can accept input values called parameters:

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
Call it with an argument:
greet("Alice")

Return Values:
Functions can return results using the return keyword:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

Built-in vs. User-defined Functions:
•	Built-in: Python includes many functions like print(), len(), type().
•	User-defined: You create these using def.
