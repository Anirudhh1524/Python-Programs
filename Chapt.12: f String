f-strings (formatted string literals) are a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals. 

How to Use f-Strings
•	Prefix the string with f or F
•	Place variables or expressions inside {}
name = "Om"
age = 22
print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")
Output:
Hello, my name is Om and I'm 22 years old.

Key Features
•	Inline expressions: You can include calculations or method calls:
•	x = 10
•	y = 5
•	print(f"The sum of x and y is {x + y}")
•	Date formatting:
•	from datetime import date
•	today = date.today()
•	print(f"Today's date is {today:%B %d, %Y}")
•	Object representation:
•	class Person:
•	    def __str__(self):
•	        return "Person object"
•	p = Person()
•	print(f"This is a {p}")
•	Debugging with self-documenting expressions (Python 3.8+):
•	value = 42
•	print(f"{value=}")  # Output: value=42
