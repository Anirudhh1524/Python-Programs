What is a Variable?
A **variable** is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. You can assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

python
name = "Alice"       # string variable
age = 30             # integer variable
height = 5.6         # float variable
is_student = True    # boolean variable

Rules for Naming Variables

1.	Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
2.	Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
3.	Cannot start with a number
4.	Case-sensitive (`Name` and `name` are different)

Types of Variables

Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare the type explicitly:
1.	int – whole numbers (`10`, `-3`)
2.	float – decimal numbers (`3.14`, `-0.5`)
3.	str – text (`"hello"`, `'world'`)
4.	bool – logical values (`True`, `False`).
5.	list, tuple, dict, set – collections.

You Can Reassign Variables

x = 5
x = "hello"  # now x is a string
