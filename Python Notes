DIFFERENCE: **modules**, **libraries**, **packages**, and **frameworks** 


### üß© Module
- A **module** is the smallest unit of code reuse.
- It‚Äôs typically a single file (like `math.py`) containing functions, classes, or variables.
- Used to organize code into logical chunks.
- **Example**: `os.py`, `random.py` in Python.


### üìö Library
- A **library** is a collection of modules or packages that provide specific functionality.
- You call its functions to perform tasks‚Äî**you control the flow**.
- **Example**: `NumPy` for numerical computing, `Lodash` in JavaScript.


### üìÅ Package
- A **package** is a directory that contains multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file (in Python).
- It helps organize related modules into a namespace.
- Can include sub-packages.
- **Example**: `requests` package in Python.


### üèóÔ∏è Framework
- A **framework** is a structured platform for building applications.
- It includes libraries, tools, and rules for development.
- **It controls the flow**‚Äîyou fill in the details (known as *Inversion of Control*).
- **Example**: `Django` for web apps in Python, `React` for UI in JavaScript.
