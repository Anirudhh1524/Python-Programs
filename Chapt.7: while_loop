while condition:

# code block
•	condition: A boolean expression. If True, the loop runs.
•	code block: Indented statements that execute each time the condition is true.
Example
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
This prints numbers from 1 to 5. The loop stops when i becomes 6.
Infinite Loop
If the condition never becomes false, the loop runs forever:
while True:
       print("This will run forever!")

Loop Control Statements
•	if: add condition in loop
•	break: Exits the loop early.
•	continue: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.
•	else: Executes once when the loop condition becomes false (unless exited with break).
Example with break and else
i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print("Loop ended naturally")
