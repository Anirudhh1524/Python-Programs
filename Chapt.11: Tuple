In Python, a tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. 

Key Characteristics of Tuples
•	Ordered: Elements maintain their position and can be accessed via indexing.
•	Immutable: Once created, elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
•	Allows duplicates: You can have repeated values.
•	Defined using parentheses: ( )

Creating Tuples
# Basic tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# Mixed data types
mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)

# Single-element tuple (note the comma!)
single_element = (42,)

# Empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()

Accessing Tuple Elements
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
What You Can't Do
•	You can't modify elements: my_tuple[0] = 99 → ❌ Error
•	You can't append or remove items

What You Can Do
•	Use indexing and slicing
•	Iterate with loops
•	Nest tuples
•	Use them as dictionary keys (because they’re hashable)
